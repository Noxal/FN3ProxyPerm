# F3NProxyPerm

If you press F3 + N or use the gamemode switcher (F3 + F4) on a server with permissions for /gamemode, but without op, your Minecraft client will not allow you to actually change your gamemode. This is because the minecraft client requires to know that you are a server operator. This plugin was built solely to mitigate that issue.

## Requirements
- [PacketEvents](https://github.com/retrooper/packetevents) (required)
- [LuckPerms](https://github.com/lucko/LuckPerms) (optional)

## Permissions
- f3nperm.use - Allows use of gamemode switcher
